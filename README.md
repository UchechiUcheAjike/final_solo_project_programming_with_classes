## Tetris game 
My version of the classic Tetris game created by Russian designer Alexey Pajitnov. The game allows players rotate falling blocks in a strategic way. The players will try their best to get the blocks off from the screen top as much as possible. When the blocks eventually stack up to the top of the screen the game comes to an end, and the player loses. Tetris is a puzzle game.
