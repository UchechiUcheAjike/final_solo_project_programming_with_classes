"""
Abstraction - This program uses abstraction, since the whole program was broken into smaller pieces/classes
Encapsulation - This program uses encapsulation, since some of the constant variables are private and they cannot be changed
Inheritance -  The Square class inherits from the Shapes class 
Polymorphism - 

polymorphism makes the program be scattered into multiple parts containing all functions, logic, conditions,
 operations and data necessary to perform an action
 
 with polymorphism we summarize all of it in a single line containing a call to perform all these actions. 
 So it's easier and faster to see what that single line of code is doing.
polymorphism can also override classes
